# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the future of robotics education. This textbook provides a comprehensive journey from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in **Physical AI** and **Humanoid Robotics**.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents intelligence that exists beyond screens and digital environments. It's AI that:

- **Operates in the real world** with physical constraints
- **Perceives through sensors** like cameras, LIDAR, and IMUs
- **Acts through actuators** to manipulate its environment
- **Learns from embodied experience** rather than just data

Unlike traditional AI confined to data centers, Physical AI must understand physics, navigate spaces, and interact safely with humans.

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots represent the next frontier because:

1. **🏢 Human-Centric Infrastructure** - Our world is designed for bipedal human bodies
2. **🤝 Natural Interaction** - Humans instinctively understand humanoid gestures and expressions
3. **📊 Data Abundance** - Massive amounts of human motion data enable transfer learning
4. **🔄 Versatility** - One platform for multiple tasks without hardware redesign

## Course Philosophy

This course takes an **AI-first approach** to robotics. Instead of focusing solely on mechanical engineering, we emphasize:

- **Simulation-first development** using digital twins
- **AI-powered perception** and decision-making
- **Natural language interfaces** for human-robot collaboration
- **Production-ready frameworks** like ROS 2 and NVIDIA Isaac

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll create a **fully autonomous humanoid robot** that can:

- ✅ Listen to voice commands via Whisper
- ✅ Plan actions using LLMs
- ✅ Navigate obstacles with VSLAM
- ✅ Identify and manipulate objects
- ✅ Operate in both simulated and real environments

## Course Structure

### 🔧 Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Master the industry-standard middleware for robot control and communication.

### 🎮 Module 2: Digital Twin & Simulation
Create virtual replicas using Gazebo and Unity for rapid, safe development.

### 🚀 Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
Leverage GPU-accelerated AI for perception, navigation, and planning.

### 🗣️ Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrate modern AI models for natural language control and autonomous behavior.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Programming**: Intermediate Python skills
- **Math**: Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- **AI Background**: Familiarity with neural networks and training concepts
- **Linux**: Comfortable with command-line operations

## Hardware Requirements

This course is computationally intensive. Minimum requirements:

- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3070 or better (RTX 4000 series recommended)
- **RAM**: 32GB minimum, 64GB recommended
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Storage**: 200GB+ SSD free space

See the [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/requirements) section for detailed specifications and alternatives.

## Learning Approach

Each module combines:

- **📖 Conceptual Foundation** - Understand the "why" behind each technology
- **💻 Hands-On Labs** - Build and experiment with working code
- **🎯 Progressive Projects** - Apply knowledge to increasingly complex challenges
- **🏆 Capstone Integration** - Culminate in a complete autonomous system

## Getting Started
